While the current version of the website is functional, I have plans to optimize its performance to enhance the user experience. Potential optimization areas include:
- [ ] **Image Compression:** Optimizing image sizes for faster loading.
- [ ] **Caching Strategies:** Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce load times.
- [ ] **Code Refactoring:** Streamlining and improving the efficiency of the codebase.
